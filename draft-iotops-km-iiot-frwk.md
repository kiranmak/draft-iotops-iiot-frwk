--- abstract

Industry control networks host a diverse set of non-internet protocols supporting Industrial-IoT and legacy device connections. These networks are physically separated from the enterprise networks and have been slow to adopt the virtualization technologies. Virtualization is necessary to remove the boundaries between the enterprise and process control networks. This document specifies a framework for the converged industrial network. Specifically, it focuses on the virtual PLC scenario. It covers transition technologies required for the convergence of industrial devices with the enterprise application endpoints.

# Introduction {#intro}

There is a little cross-over between the network technologies used in the Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) environments as the architecture of industrial networks has evolved independently from the IT networks.
While industrial networks focussed on deterministic communication, safety, and reliability of process control, they have trailed behind in the adoption of virtualization capabilities. 
The leading vision of industry automation heavily relies on compute and data-intensive services.

Although the virtualization of SCADA and other systems (HMI, MES, Historian, etc.) has happened, the low-level PLCs have remained on the factory floor. Virtualization of PLC is a  topic of great interest for fully automated and remote operations in the manufacturing and similar process control industry because it allows direct control of low-level processes from the applications.
There are two primary challenges for PLC virtualization. First, one is support for real-time or deterministic functionality on the nodes where this PLC software will reside; secondly, a distributed converged network architecture that provides movement of data from devices, sensors, and actuators with the same pre-defined latency and safety artifacts.

Virtualized PLCs require a network that supports all the characteristics of the existing framework and helps make them extensible with scale.

This document presents the baseline industrial architecture to demonstrate that
the well-established hierarchical architecture poses difficulty for the adoption of virtualization in industrial networks.
The scope of the document is to focus on the aspects of network-layer technologies  for enabling virtualization capabilities both at the endpoint in the network.

The architectural components in this document are concerned with the
identification of requirements to be met when introducing virtualized PLC,
and in doing so, arrive at a converged industrial network architecture
which supports emerging trends better.
In comparison to the current IP architectures, industrial networks
are required to support the coexistence of several industrial protocols, and the converged architecture must support existing mechanisms.

This document discusses those requirements and proposes a path to converged industrial networking.

# Architecture
This section discusses the baseline architecture and corresponding design choices made for inter-operation between the enterprise applications and factory floors.

##  Industrial Network Architecture

The physical network architecture for process control and operations centric networks  as shown in {{indusarch}} is rigidly hierarchical.  Note that this figure is over-simplified and in general, each level will have additional hierarchies to extend networks for scale. For example, a PLC that controlling certain fieldbus devices may be controlled by another PLC controller which  runs ProfiNet protocol. In such cases protocol translation gateways are needed. Between these gateways there may also be intermediate network switches to extend the range (physical distance) of connectivity on the factory floor. Similarly, system integrators also need a variety of translation gateways to extract data from field devices to be fed in to MIS, HMI and other enterprise applications.

The hierarchical architecture follows security oriented zones called Purdue model  (see {{Appendix}}) in which each zone further contains well-defined levels. The communication across the zone tends to get complex as each zone runs over a different technology. Among the three zones (Manufacturing, IDMZ and Enterprise), the enterprise zone network is all IP while manufacturing and IDMZ network on factory floor are a  combination of IP and Industrial protocols. IP-based routers are used in manufacturing-zone when there is need to extend the network across different cells on factory floors. There are a large number of IP based firewalls and  gateways that perform translation in IDMZ but are required to look at transport payload to determine the industrial protocols and corresponding matching rules.

Factory floor devices do not depend on protocols but the PLCs they attach to have to be discoverable in the network.  Higher layer applications directly interact with PLCs for send and receive commands and data from the field devices. There is need to connect PLCs to the industry network. The data generated by sensors is transmitted by PLCs to industry control systems (SCADA, HMI, MES).
Both DCS and SCADA systems collect data from process instruments and respond with  commands to the actuators. They control several process control loop instances simultaneously to handle complex processes. Originally, such systems were built using proprietary hardware and software, operating in its own zone without additional connectivity. Operators had to work from centralized control room because these systems did not support remote access. The best practices for data delivery to other systems was in the form of reports, which caused significant time lag.

I/O devices generate plenty of data and also accept process control commands. For an application to handle a variety of low-level protocol translations can be extremely challenging, therefore, technologies like OPC-UA or common messaging broker mechanisms such as MQTT have been proposed. OPC-UA {{OPC_ARCH}} and MQTT {{MQTT_SPEC}} differ in design but both are motivated by presentation of sensor data and commands in a common format {{data-model}}. They are higher-level protocols that  potentially be transmitted over any underlying mechanism, although TCP/IP is most commonly used.

# Challenges and Limitations

It is also evident from the ICA-95 model (described in {{Appendix}}) that the business applications are centralized in the enterprise networks, however, the current trends are adopting virtualization technologies all across the systems.

## Scalability in Industry Control Networks

In the industrial control system, infrastructure is tightly coupled to the physical environment, having large numbers of nodes connected through different network segments, integrated with diverse software technologies, and running on heterogeneous hardware platforms. This gets more complex every time new sensors or actuators are added on the factory floors and needed to expand the operations. When a new set of devices (sensors, controllers, etc.) are to be added, a general rule of thumb is to achieve this in a non-disruptive manner. As a result, a new network is created by adding new intermediate gateways for translations, switches, or routers, without any coordination. This naturally leads to overheads in device management and fragility in applications, since they need different set of interfaces, addresses, access control policies to access each network.

##  Protocol Diversity
The devices on factory floors (e.g. fieldbus devices) are controlled by PLCs often communication over a one or more  non-internet protocols such as Modbus, Profibus, CANbus, Profinet, etc {{SURV}}. There are more than 100 different protocols each with it's own packet format and are used  in the industry. When there is need to inter-connect two or more cells, corresponding translation of protocols need to be done from source and destination end points (device to controllers). Since the number of devices supported per fieldbus controller are limited (ranging from 32 to 256), the number of PLCs continue to grow as new sensor/actuators are deployed. Moreover, additional deployments are not integrated with existing network and a new network is created.

## Communication between Enterprise and Factory 

There is another aspect of protocol conversion which is indirect. Instead of end-to-end connection, factory floor PDUs are transmitted as transport encapsulations in IP. This necessitates the need for firewalls to look beyond the IP header. Thus the overall manageability of networks is also complex, it is far more difficult to change device configuration than changing the traffic flowing through those devices.

ISA-95 is poor match for automation as it lacks flexibility in integrating business services and process control. Yet any new proposal must preserve the characteristics of each zone. For example, manufacturing requires low-latency time bound operations; this includes PLCs.

Enabling virtualization capabilities requires enhancement to existing could overcome these challenges. a converged industry architecture is required to overcome these challenges. The converged technology, seamlessly integrates the industrial and enterprise protocols.

## Handling Large Scale Sensory Data

 Current data-collection approaches use the underlying network opaquely. This could pose challenges due to sensors generating large volume of data causing congestion on links across the network and thus  adversely impacting the performance due to decreased throughput, packet loss, and delay, Secondly, since the messaging protocols are over TCP/IP, currently there are no explicit priority of deterministic message delivery behavior to guarantee of low-latency data deliveries.  

## Virtualization of Components in Industrial Systems

Virtualization enables separation of software  from the hardware. It is foundation for desegregating different system components such as operating systems, management tools, service logic, and data. This allows flexible placement of  different functions in the system and on-demand scaling of resources.

In  case of Industrial control systems, by virtualizing SCADA, MES and HMI etc. {{VPLC_CONV}} the software can run on commodity hardware or general-purpose CPUs. There are several benefits to this approach - it is cost-effective since specialized hardware is not required, more agile since software upgrades can be carried out more frequently. Most importantly, a virtualized software can be placed anywhere, often close to the source of data it needs to process, thus creating a opportunities for distributed architecture.

This in turn leads to leveraging edge compute networking for multi-site integration.

While applications and services are beginning to get  disaggregated, the virtualization of PLCs themselves is  at a very early stage. Conceptually, a virtual PLC means that the controller functions are separated from the I/O modules of the devices.

# Converged Architectural Concepts

The following sections describe the foundational concepts of converged industry network architecture. It has two important design principles (i) Ability to virtualize infrastructure end-points, (ii) Disaggregated I/O Modules, (iii) Converged Industry Fabric.

## Overview

{{convarch}} represents a converged network fabric (bottom-left) that enables the transfer of data between software system components (top-left) and the physical devices (bottom-right). The fabric is a shared network infrastructure that allows all the characteristics required in the industrial control networks, such as deterministic, low-latency, and real-time communications.  In {{convarch}}, "B. factory site" represents one or more cell (locations) of the physical devices. Each cell group belongs to one physical site, and there can be multiple such sites. In other words, a cell site may be the smallest network in this fabric. "A. Software components" emulate different OT and IT functions hosted in a cloud-like environment which is distributed, i.e., components may be located at various sites or at the edge to support low-latency, deterministic applications. Both field and software components are connected over a converged network (shown as "C. <network"> in {{convarch}}), which presents a unified view of the network infrastructure interconnecting software and field components.

The converged fabric is composed of 3 types of network elements with specific roles.

{: vspace="0"}
CISN (Converged Industry Service Node):
: The application or service nodes that get virtualized and softwarized maybe instantiated anywhere in the Industry network independent of the I/O module placement. They are placed in cloud or at the edge or the factory floor itself depending on the usage and type of application. From the communication perspective, these nodes following the state of the art in IT could use technologies and protocol such as IPv6 addresses {{!RFC200}}, and service chains {{!RFC8300}} for steering between  different service nodes. Their interface to network will have specific transport requirements (when not transmitted as overlay).
  
CIFR (Converged Industry Fabric Router):
: Network nodes that form the converged fabric and understand  the traffic flows between  I/O modules and applications. CIFRs are all expected to run a uniform suite of protocols. In a much simplified view the fabric maybe a core IPv4 or IPv6 based forwarding plane, regardless whether overlay technologies (such as VPN, VxLAN etc.) are used). Potentially  interconnected over different physical media technologies (commodity or TSN) Ethernet.
: One aspect of converged fabric is unified understanding or structure of the packets flowing through it. It leads to requirements mentioned in {{gen_req}}.
: CIFRs also perform functions for WAN interfaces and multi site interconnections. The routers performing this function will be at the upper edge of the physical network.
  
CIIG (Converged I/O-Gateways)
: These gateways are the lower-level edges of the converged fabric.They are very similar to the existing PLC gateways that are purpose-built for translation between fieldbus/fieldbus or fieldbus/IT protocols. In contrast to traditional gateways CIIGs could be stateless and optionally provide more secure control to I/O device. 

## Component Virtualization

In the existing deployments, components such as HMI, Historian, MES, and SCADA systems run on dedicated hardware. Virtualizing these system components can be consolidated on a single general-purpose hardware platform, reducing the number of hardware devices and improving the security of data exchanges among these systems. 

Virtual PLC (vPLC) is a concept in which the control part of factory devices is decoupled from the I/O component. With vPLCs, the I/O stays local to the machines (sensors, actuators, and drives), while the controller logic lives as a software service implemented over RT-hypervisors. Other components can now directly interface with process control to alter the behavior and send commands through virtualized PLCs. By implementing low-latency and a deterministic behavior in the network fabric, all the software components are part of the execution environment on one side of the fabric, capable of leveraging mature IP-based technologies.

Although an exploratory work {{VPLC_CONV}} and {{VPLC_IIC}} propose I/O field-buses to be replaced with the high-speed, deterministic media (such as Ethernet). The legacy systems (such as serial fieldbus interfaces) will continue to exist in the foreseeable future. Thus, the architecture must support the communication between the field-bus I/O and PLCs, even when the PLCs are virtualized. This implies that the fabric will still need protocol translation gateways on cell sites, but this need not be pervasive and localized at the edges of the I/O modules.

### Application and Services

Component virtualization enables co-location of different service functions on the same hypervisor or entirely at a different location regardless of what security zone they belong to. The constraints aware path chain can be set using {{!RFC7665}}. Moreover, it provides multiple service function chain to support different applications. This type of architecture along with NFV {{ETSI_GS_NFV_003}} can be extremely resource efficient. 

Several sensors emit time-series style data, that can add to the bandwidth consumption to the information going to the cloud. Deploying big-data application closer on the edge and scale them on-demand provides a sophisticated tool to disaggregate  processing of sensory data and summarize for the cloud-enterprise applications.

## I/O Modules and Field Components

A manufacturing facility can be located at more than one site and each site is further divided into cells. Further the machinery, actuators, sensors are associated with the cell connected to the PLCs. These controllers run different protocols such as Ethernet, RT-Ethernet, Modbus, ProfiNet etc.

In a vPLC supported environment, the I/O cards are responsible for media access conversion from in and out of the converged fabric. Even the support for legacy PLCs is similar to vPLCs, with the role reduced to only translation function.  

## Converged Fabric 

Converged fabric shown as "B." in {{convarch}} is central to the architecture. The connectivity is largely Ethernet based (except I/O device interfaces), potentially running IP protocols on the switches and routers in the network.

Since this is a logical fabric, the connectivity is local on a factory floor and can be extended to multiple sites. Interconnecting different sites will use WAN  functions. The fabric breaks the hierarchical structure and topology can now be designed as fat-tree (or leaf-spine) network which provides overall more number and multiple deterministic paths between two end points. 

A key characteristic of legacy Industry networks is that they do not require frequent changes and therefore, topology changes are not dynamic. The fabric could potentially use a combination of software-defined connectivity with IP routing protocols. The routing protocols will maintain the infrastructure reachability among the network nodes and software-defined solutions will manage flow of traffic in a deterministic manner addressing the low-latency and deterministic data delivery of certain type of flows.


# Requirements

## General Requirements {#gen_req}

- The most basic requirement for converged fabric is  efficiency of connections, i.e. the connection to a low-level factory devices is uniform (or homogenized) similar to applications. 
  
- The converged-fabric shall support traffic segmentation connection changes between the devices. It should not have adverse effect on deterministic, low latency behavior due to these segmented traffic. This also includes that the determinacy of legacy flows should be no worse than before the fabric. The methods to to support include virtual network technologies inside the fabric such as VxLAN, VPNs, etc.
  
- The fabric protocols used must not limit to a specific topology. It should support efficient distributed connectivity architecture to prevent bottlenecks and improve scale. It can be expected for an entire cell to be added or removed on-demand. This type of changes shall be dynamic (i.e. does not require long-term planning) and non disruptive (no impact on existing performance metrics).
  
- The fabric is a logical representation of LAN and WAN connections. In this regard, appropriate perimeter policies MUST be enforced on traffic. One possible direction towards this is enforcement of ICA-95 zone identification.

## Device Specific Requirements

-  Addresses scope: As the scale of industry network grows, there will be many same type of devices with limited address space (a fieldbus or ModBus address limits up to 256) all across the floor. Therefore, a structured addressing scheme is necessary to uniquely identify each device from a remote command center.
  
-  Converged Namespace: must be supported with the solution. The solution must not required different operations and management schemes for devices attached to I/O modules vs IT applications. A common namespace that aligns with business goals can simplify management. For example, assigning segmented identifiers for each level (PLCs, cell sites, type of application etc.) and concatenating them together provides helps industry operations considering that factory devices are dynamic in the topology.
  
-  Network Identifiers: Each device should be identifiable in the network by what application it can talk to. The network identification shall be provided for setting up security or firewall policies. Note: today legacy devices do not have network identifiers.
  
- Legacy support: Architecture must provide legacy device support for deployed protocol formats and their core capabilities. This is needed to maintain  non-disruptive operations.

- Once part of the larger fabric, the devices must be discoverable. Given the 'physical-location' of the device can often be preprogrammed, device on-boarding should allow a device to be auto-configurable. 

- The auto configuration procedures should be efficient comparable to the processing capabilities of the I/O devices.
- On-boarding procedures (manual or automatic) must have built-in or well-defined authentication procedures.
  
- Device policies: Each device  connects to at least  one controller (PLC or a gateway). When the network detects a misbehaving controller, the policies should define the default behavior of the device (such as quarantined from the network along with the gateway or allow it to operate autonomously with default settings, or shutdown etc).
  
Further motivation and analysis for adapting to OT/IT asymmetric address formats is covered in {{?I-D.draft-km-industrial-internet-requirements}}.
  
## Key Performance Indicator Requirements

- Performance of industry operations depend on the deterministic behavior of devices. The network must preserve and support this attribute such as the legacy device connections with controllers.
  
- Safety mechanisms : To keep a factory floor hazard and accident free environment, the system should implement built-in mechanisms for proper operation of a devices (i.e. software commands sent from vPLC must not exceed thresholds).
  
- Security: mechanisms should be implemented to protect man-in-the-middle attack. Knowing that E2E encryption procedures on device can impact low-latency, due to low processing power, light-weight mechanisms should be devised (such as reduce the data to be encrypted, account it in KPIs, etc).

## Virtualization Related Requirements

The topologies in the manufacturing zones do not change frequently and devices are  designated in a zone or a cell for long-term use. Such observations can help simplify network designs. As such, industry networks substantially benefit from a hybrid approach of software-defined networking and distributed routing. Former for initial provisioning, latter for reachability and health of the fabric. Such hybrid approaches eliminates the need for complex  routing protocol features. 

- Edge compute and networking should provide secure
  
## Virtualized PLC Requirements

- Solution must provide a secure method of pairing, authenticating a virtualized PLCs with their I/O devices. 
- Virtualization allows multiple PLCs to control the same device. This can potentially lead to conflicts in device operation. Therefore, careful policies are required to prioritize operation across the PLCs. 
-   
Currently, L0 and L1 devices do not use any transport protocol. The data is embedded after control header. With a network layer solution, TCP maybe too heavy for field-bus devices. Some other means of assuring device delivery will be needed.



# IANA Considerations

This document requires no actions from IANA.

# Security Considerations

The architecture at the very least must adhere to the security guidance provided by ICS-95.

# Appendix A.  Purdue Model (ICA-95) {#Appendix}

The International Society of Automation (ICA) has developed a model {{ISA95}}  to describe automated
interfaces between enterprise and control systems.  In this widely deployed hierarchical model, five levels are defined and they follow a strict ordering of interfaces across the  levels. At the lowest level  0, are the physical devices while enterprise applications are at level 5. In between these two levels, there are several supervisory, management, and intermediate data collection applications that provide information to

## Separation between Manufacturing and Enterprise Networks
The ICA-95  architecture recommends hierarchy, thereby a separation between factory devices and applications through three different security zones called Manufacturing, DMZ and enterprise zones as shown in {{Automation}}  as below:

- Enterprise Security Zone:
: The IT applications reside in enterprise networks and perform tasks necessary for business operations such as inventory control, supply-chain logistics, schedule and capacity planning. They need to collect data from the OT systems in order to make those decisions.

- Industrial Demilitarized Zone:
: The OT and IT networks were designed to prevent direct communication between them. The IDMZ serves as an information sharing layer between the IT and OT (L4 and L3) systems. This indicates that additional security rules, inspection and protection of device identity and access is necessary when transiting from L3 to L4.

- Manufacturing Zone:
: Consists of Levels 0 through 3 site wide production system.  Operations at level 3 (L3) Support site-wide view of the production system. They also provide data to L4. Area supervisory control (L2) performs operation and control over a zone or smaller area in a production floor. Each area has specific set of tasks or operations to perform. Basic control  at level 1 (L1) is for the actual control of the equipment. The L1 components such include PLCs; they send commands to L0 equipments to perform tasks (e.g. start motor, alter pressure level, or reduce motor speed). Finally, actual process takes place at level 0 (L0). At this level for the process equipments performing actual operations are performed. This include equipment and devices such as motors, pressure valves, temperature, speed, etc sensors, etc.

The devices or controllers at level 1 are the ones of specific interest for virtualization and the corresponding challenges are covered in later section.

## Collaborating with SDOs with Industry Network Focus

The paradigms of networking in OT are quite different than IP based best-effort networking protocols. Yet, IETF protocols are extensively used in OT applications. Often, it is not possible to get contributors directly from the OT sectors, then it would make more sense to coordinate with well-established consortia where OT scenarios and requirements are is discussed may be utilized. Two well established foundations are IIC {{IIC}} and OPC-UA {{OPC}}.
For example, a {{IIC_TALK}} provided overview of IIC activities.

Industrial IoT Consortium (IIC) provides use cases, scenarios, and best-practice frameworks to solve specific problems and solution pain points. It is a rich resources of case studies and demonstrations of different test beds. The IIC itself is not involved in standards development, but may help in formalizing requirements, further insights into solutions developed in IETF, and potentially help adoption of those solutions.

Open Platform Communications-Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) provides interoperability across different hardware platforms using a standard data model. It standardizes various information models, corresponding client-server architecture and defines necessary access mechanisms to those information models.
The OPC-UA is an abstraction layer to provide common interface to different data look-up and event notifications. A number of information models are provided by OPC-UA can be found here {{OPC_INFO}}.
Foe example, OPC has a specification on PLCs. It abstracts PLC specific protocols (such as Modbus, Profibus, etc.) into a standardized interface allowing HMI/SCADA systems to interface with a middleware that converts generic-OPC read/write requests into device-specific requests and vice-versa.

> Note: OPC-UA information model similar to YANG?

IETF solutions will focus on leveraging or extending IETF technologies for IT and OT integration which is at the infrastructure or communication layer. Thus, providing protocols that could potentially benefit higher-level OPC-UA work.

Both IIC and OPC could provide guidance to the lower level work.

- For Discussion: assuming there is an IIN framework - how does it fit in the OPC-UA architecture and facilitate adoption of existing information models.
