--- abstract

Industry control networks host a diverse set of non-internet protocols supporting Industrial-IoT and legacy device connections. These networks are physically separated from the enterprise networks and have been slow to adopt the virtualization technologies. Virtualization is necessary to remove the boundaries between the enterprise and process control networks. This document specifies a framework for the converged industrial network. Specifically, it focuses on the virtual PLC scenario. It covers transition technologies required for the convergence of industrial devices with the enterprise application endpoints.

# Introduction {#intro}

Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) have been instrumental to the growth of automation in industrial process control. Industry 4.0 and similar initiatives have put even more emphasis on automation of the entire production process. For example, a typical workflow in the Smart Factory to manufacture customized orders (reconfigurable manufacturing {{RECONF}}) is executed autonomously, comprising several related and inter-dependent processes. In this workflow, all the dependencies and transitions occur seamlessly without human intervention - such as requesting inventory before it becomes unavailable, dispatching a request for specific maintenance, performing quality control on the material, and adjusting operations automatically.

This type of system level automation requires a very close coordination between PLCs (low-level machine controlling components) on the factory floors and the high-level decision making software. However, in the current Industry control architecture, PLCs operations are not only isolated from higher-level components, they operate in an entirely different proprietary hardware environment.

Virtualization is a proven technique to abstract software logic from the underlying hardware. Information Technologies (IT) have proven that virtualization benefits cost savings, flexibility and efficient resource usage. In the context of Industrial networks, virtualization  serves to integrate IT and OT software components, essential for integrated automation.

This document describes 'virtualized PLC' concept and how they will be realized. In {{problem}} limitations in physical PLCs are covered along with the benefits of virtualized PLC. Finally, {{req}} discusses requirements to support virtualized PLCs and their impact on the network.


# Terminology

{: vspace="0"}
Industrial Control Network:
 : The industrial control networks are interconnection of equipments used for the operation,
 control or monitoring of machines in the industry environment. It involves different level
 of communications - between field bus devices, digital controllers and software applications

Industry Automation:
 : Mechanisms that enable  machine to machine communication by use of technologies that enable
 automatic control and operation of industrial devices and  processes leading to minimizing human intervention.

Control Loop:
: Control loops are part of process control systems in with desired process response is provided as an input to the controller which  performs corresponding action (using actuators) and reads the output values. Since there is no error correction performed, these are called open control loops.

Feedback Control Loop:
: Feedback control loop is a system in which the output of a control system is continuously measured and compared to the input reference value. Any deviation  from the input value is used by the controller to adjust output value for desired response. Since there is a feedback of error signal to the input, these are called closed control loops.

Programmable logic controllers (PLC):
 : Industrial computers/servers for the control of manufacturing processes such as assembly lines.

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA):
 : Software System to control industrial processes and collect and manage data.

Distributed Control Systems (DCS):
: Systems of sensors and controllers that are distributed throughout a plant.

Manufacturing Execution System (MES):
: Systems that connect production equipment across the factory floor, or multiple plants or sites.

Fieldbus Devices:
: Operational Technology field devices include valves, transmitters, switches and actuators etc.

Integrated Industrial Network (IIN):
  : The term introduced in this document to represent a converged view of OT and IT networks.

Virtualized PLC (vPLC):
  : A software component of PLC, in which the control part of factory devices
   is decoupled from the I/O component.  With vPLCs, the I/O stays local
   to the machines (sensors, actuators, and drives), while the
   controller logic lives as a software service implemented over RT-
   hypervisors.

Scan-Cycle:
 : A scan cycle is the time taken to read the inputs, execute the program (e.g. ladder logic), and update the outputs.  The actual scan time is affected by the processing speed of the PLC, the size of the program, the type of instructions used in the program. In virtualized PLCs general-purpose processor speed and the amount of memory available is much higher than most physical PLCs.

# Virtualized PLCs

## Definition

Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are specialized physical devices (or computers) that are used to control the operation of machines by coordinating the input sensors (temperature, pressure, position, vibration, humidity, torque, etc. readings) to the output actuators (such as motion control, voltage change, pressure valves, etc). PLC components include of Control unit, memory (to store the data, state and process control instructions) and I/O modules to communicate with fieldbus devices (sensors and actuators) using different standard or proprietary protocols.

When compared with commodity CPUS, most PLC control unit processing power is extremely low, whereas new complex process control applications require  sophisticated and faster compute capabilities.  Utilizing  commodity grade CPUs for many of the PLC function blocks is one option for to provide higher compute and memory for PLC programs  by separating its control unit and memory from the physical PLCs. This will leaves only I/O modules connected to the devices. Thus,

 >> Virtualized PLC is a hardware-agnostic abstraction of the control unit and memory functions of a PLC. It is hardware-independent and still needs an interface to communicate with the I/O modules.

The concept has been discussed both in research {{PLC-40}} and industry {{VPLC-DRAGOS}} {{VPLC_IIC}} {{VPLC_CONV}}. In the following section motivation for virtualized-PLCs.

## Limitations with Physical PLCs

### Integrated Application Control Loop
Application performance can be improved with better coordination between applications and field devices. One way to achieve this is when seamless sharing of both data and control operations and it is possible when both application and controller software use common language or interface. Today OPC-UA model is well-established and provides protocol independent data model for standard representation of several fieldbus protocols and requires a translation layer.
With software PLCs, not only the collection of data but even control can be unified even more easily since the software PLCs are already hardware independent.

Similar to IT, manufacturing and process industry is evolving to non-monolithic mode of system operations. In a large scale industry, several control processes are running and having a high performance requirements.

### Single purpose to Multi purpose
Currently, PLC controllers are designed for a single purpose long-term use. There is an implicit expectation that once installed, PLC functions and corresponding I/O devices will not be replaced for many years. This paradigm makes it difficult for industries to adopt changing requirements and can be prohibitive to adoption of new technologies and deployment of new types of sensors that could provide better monitoring. With virtualized PLC re-programming control logic becomes lot easier.

### Simulation and Analytics
Physical PLCs are difficult to troubleshoot. Upon failures, operators have to manually study the log files to generate traces from historical data. Since Virtual PLCs are hardware-agnostic, they are almost identical to their simulation counter parts. When replay with real historical event data, run-time state of a PLC at any instance in past can be recreated which would help to troubleshoot and root-cause failure events. It is  difficult to do this type of root-cause analysis with physical PLCs.

### Managing Complexity

Complexity is a trait of an overall system architecture. With Physical PLCS, the plant-floors will continue to deploy proprietary protocols and PLCs leading to either having to manage solutions from different vendors or locked into one vendor provided solutions. While former adds to complexity, latter may not get to use innovative outside a specific vendor.

Architecturally, PLCs require a lot of different types of connections such as PLC-PLC (peer to peer), PLC-SCADA, PLC-HMI etc. Depending on the interface and protocol, scaling PLCs would lead to a higher number of gateways (and more wiring) the are difficult from maintenance perspective and can also be cause of poor performance. With physical PLCs, heterogeneity of protocol interface will not go away.

Faults with PLC input/output (I/O) modules and field devices account for 80 per cent of system failures. Common causes of failure include rugged environment that devices are subjected to. In some cases, consolidating different PLCs on a single powerful PC and protecting that one PC from failures of power outage, electromagnetic or radio frequency interference is lot easier than protecting a high number of PLCs. In other cases, PLCs can be placed in the edge network, separated from the rugged environment.

## Benefits and Opportunities

### Processing Capabilities
Virtualization enables running software on commodity hardware. One of the most important benefit is the ability to use more sophisticated processors to perform complex computations beyond whats available on legacy PLCs (floating point, arithmetic operations, counters, etc). Currently, there are already PLC control units supported on FPGAs {{FPGA_PLC}} indicating the need for faster and parallel processing. virtualization will enable further integration of such  different With the availability of high-en.

### Flexibility and Efficient Resource Use

Traditional PLCs are fixed-function controllers that are typically used for specific job on the factory floor. Now there is more emphasis on customizations which will require PLCs to be programmed every time a new custom product is requested. This could lead to longer manufacturing cycles. Today, software-based PLCs are available for general-purpose commercial hardware but they have been mainly used for simulation and training purposes. Virtualization can enable running multiple instances of with its own set of allocated resources. Thus, it will be possible to run different configurations for different customizations simultaneously with efficient use of resources only on-demand.

Moreover, when virtualized PLCs and IT applications are on same platform, it is possible to have close coordination between the OT and IT functions. Although it may not be a compelling, virtualized PLCs potentially eliminate need for dedicated PLCs on the floor, creating space and reducing number of interconnections.

### Interoperability and Optimization

Having abstracted PLC logic provides an option to use a common communication protocol thus improving interoperability between different vendors supplied I/O modules. Besides improving performance, this approach also simplifies configuration, configuration and monitoring.

### Device Density on Factory Floor
With the innovations in IoT devices, it is anticipated that there will newer ways to measure, monitor and collect various environment specific metrics. Which simply means a large number of devices and corresponding increase in the number of controllers. Virtualization can further simplify control of a high number of devices through a single PLC thereby reducing network resource consumption.

While applications and services are beginning to get disaggregated, PLCs' virtualization is very early stage.

## Incremental Realization Approaches
Once virtualized,  a PLC may be placed flexible anywhere in the network and closer to the higher-level applications. However, expanding beyond a factory cite, is a drastic change from the existing isolated OT mindset. To address such concerns, the following different approaches are possible:

### Softwarized PLC
This is the basic approach with minimal change and minimal impact. A PLC software is virtualized and either runs on proprietary or commodity hardware supporting legacy I/O modules. This type of change is isolated to a specific PLC functionality and the only benefit is hardware independence. Potentially, there is a one to one replacement of physical to software PLC.

### Local Disaggregation of Control and I/O Modules {#localized}
Extending the above approach PLC control unit is developed as a software running on a commodity hardware as above; In addition, I/O modules are separated from the PLC to provide a clear separation between I/O and programmable components. It requires  trivial I/0 interconnects to do trivial fieldbus frame forwarding to I/O modules which may not require any memory or processing capability as shown in {{localized-plc}}.

Utilizing IT virtualization infrastructure, different instances of virtualized PLC may run simultaneously on a single machine or even a group of PLCs may be bundled together in a single instance of virtualized PLC. With this level of hardware independence, a virtualized PLC can be instantiated on the same hardware along with SCADA, HMI, or ICS components providing close integration of these entities. A clean separation between PLC logic from I/O module allows changes to PLC logic and I/O devices independently.

Since the location of virtualized PLC is with in manufacturing zone there is no impact on the security design.

### Fully Virtualized PLC
Eventually virtualized PLCs may be placed  anywhere (in cloud, edge or on site) in a location independent manner. All the benefits considered in {{localized}} apply with an advantage of leveraging multi-tenant edge-compute infrastructure as a tenant.

However, security zones are impacted will require network to provide more secure and safety mechanisms.

# Problem Statement {#problem}

 The addition of new PLC virtualization capabilities impacts not only the PLC device but also the network elements in the infrastructure. Design considerations must be made to ensure that such impacts facilitate automation by simplifying configurations, improving operations and management, and reducing process-change overheads. Never the less, it is a change from the current state of the Industrial Networks.

 Adopting virtualized PLCs requires a clear understanding of several challenges from the network infrastructure's perspective for recognizing new types of virtual PLC devices. This section describes the challenges, starting with brief information on the current architecture to set the context.

##  Overview of Industrial Network Architecture {#baseline}

The physical network architecture for process control, as shown in {{indusarch}} is rigidly hierarchical. Note that the figure is over-simplified, and in general, each level will have additional hierarchies to extend the networks for scale. For example, a PLC controlling a group of Fieldbus devices may, in turn, be controlled by another PLC controller {{networked-PLC}} that runs ProfiNet protocol because both sets of devices are interdependent. For such cases, protocol translation gateways are required. Several network switches are needed to interconnect gateways and numerous devices on the factory floor.

The hierarchical architecture comprises security-oriented zones known as ICA-95 model  (or Purdue model see {{Appendix}}) in which each zone contains well-defined levels. Among the three zones (Manufacturing, IDMZ, and Enterprise), the enterprise zone network is all IP, while the manufacturing and IDMZ network on the factory floor is a  combination of IP and Industrial protocols. The communication across the zone tends to get complex as each zone runs over different network technologies. A large number of IP-based firewalls and translation gateways are deployed in all the zones to control data movement between IT and OT networks.

Industry control systems (SCADA, HMI, MES) perform complex operations. They collect data from devices and simultaneously administer several process control loop instances to handle complex processes. Traditional best practices indirectly required data delivery from L2 to L3 levels in reports, which caused a significant time lag.

## Associating virtualized PLCs with IO Devices
A physical PLC is generally associated with a few I/O devices and is directly connected. The I/O modules are not required to authenticate or perform any verification on connection. A virtualized PLC is a software instance, it may now be anywhere in the network, therefore, the system must authenticate the virtualized PLC and I/O device connection pairing. This is necessary to maintain reliability and safety of the system and prevent unauthenticated PLC to interact with the software.

## Expectations from the Networks {#expectations}

The magnitude by which  compute capability is improved allows  a single virtualized controller to handle more complex and faster scan cycles. Then, the performance of the network to handle communication delays, packet formation, processing and forwarding overheads become critical to overall system performance. Additionally, to harness compute-power at lower cost use of edge-compute platforms is expected. Thus, the plant-floor networks are now extended to edge-networks expanding the security zones, creating 'new' requirements for multi-tenancy support (isolation and network segmentation) in OT networks. Note that in IT networks these technologies are mature and already standardized.

## Multiprotocol Supporting PLCs

A virtualized PLC can act as a single logical controller to communicate with a different group of I/O devices over one or more non-internet protocols such as Modbus, Profibus, CANbus, Profinet {{SURV}}, etc. Since each protocol specifies its packet format, different translation gateways are generally needed. Thus, a multi-protocol virtual PLC can reduce the number of gateways.

However, the challenge is to provide a standard communication format for different I/O devices. Since it is not feasible to have a single flat Fieldbus Fieldbus protocol due to address scale limitations (limited address space up to 256 devices), an I/O interconnect is required to perform format translation. Then the packet on the wire should be multi-protocol aware. i.e., virtualized PLC needs to know what type of Fieldbus device it is communicating with at the other end.

## Identification of virtualized PLC

The fieldbus devices are serial buses and identify PLC as a device with a specific bus address.  In the large scale network and in the application layer this much information is insufficient. It may be required for virtualized PLC to support dual addresses, one exposed for the I/O module and other for IT applications.

Moreover, as an exmaple, it is no longer sufficient to indicate basic address 0x14; it may require to specify 'device 0x14, of cell - C1 and factory floor, F1, PLC bus address 0x1 in communication path. The reachability to a specific I/O module should have complete information from virtualized PLC.

{::comment}
## Communication for Data Delivery
I/O devices (sensors, actuators) generate a large volume of data and also accept process control commands. For an application to handle a variety of low-level protocol translations can be extremely challenging, therefore, solutions such as OPC-UA {{OPC_ARCH}} or common messaging broker mechanisms MQTT {{MQTT_SPEC}} are deployed. OPC-UA is a common representation of data collected from different I/O devices; MQTT is messaging service designed for systems with low resources. Both  are higher-level protocols that are generally transmitted over TCP as shown in {{data-model}} below.

## Security Aspects {#sec-aspects}
The fundamental paradigm of security as described in ICA-95 architecture changes with virtualized PLC since the PLCs are now moved away from the local manufacturing zone. The zone aware security will not apply.

Instead, system will need a multi-dimensional security profiles. First one that encompasses both enterprise and manufacturing zones and second profile that are location specific - i.e. using secure channels such as such as VPN, IPSEC etc.

# Requirements {#req}

## Virtualized PLC Requirements

Having virtualized, a PLC's function and operation do not change. These requirements are related to how that are reached, identified and discovered in the network.

-  Addresses scope:
 A uniquely reachable address for all the fieldbus I/O devices, and PLCs is required such that intermediate network elements know how to route (or switch) to those addresses.  As such there is is no need to enforce IP addresses for fieldbus devices since they are constrained devices and IP may not be the most suitable address structure. Moreover, as the scale of industry network grows, there will be many 'same' type of devices with limited address space (a fieldbus or ModBus address limits up to 256) all across the floor. It is expected the virtualized PLC would be an IP addressed endpoint when communicating with higher level applications, but southbound communication may require some kind of a structured addressing scheme to reach fieldbus device in the network (e.g. see {{semantic-addressing}}{{asymmetric-addr}}). It maybe desirable to support variable length identifiers to handle both IT servers and I/O module type devices.

-  Converged Namespace:
 Addresses are derived from namespaces. It should be possible to associate all the endpoints (OT and IT) as part of their system defined namespace. The solution should not require different operations and management schemes for industry I/O modules vs IT applications. It will improve the security by verifying an endpoint against a namespace. However, each industry vertical should be able to choose its own namespace. For example, In some cases, classification may be based on a level (PLCs, cell sites, type of application etc.) and corresponding address is derived by concatenating them together since factory devices do not change their location often in the topology. The devices must be discoverable. Given the 'physical-location' of the device can often be preprogrammed, device on-boarding should allow a device to be auto-configurable.

-  Network Identifiers:
Virtualized PLC should be identifiable by what application it can talk to or the service they are part of {{semantic-addressing}}. The network identification is required for setting up security or firewall policies. Note: legacy devices do not have network identifiers and deeper packet inspection will be needed to identify a specific PLC. Alternately  {{semantic-addressing}} maybe useful in structuring the identifiers.

- Legacy support:
virtualized PLCs and legacy PLCs must co-exist with support for deployed protocol formats and their core capabilities. This is needed to maintain  non-disruptive operations.

- Auto configuration:
procedures should be efficient, i.e., comparable to the processing capabilities of the I/O devices. On-boarding procedures (manual or automatic) must have built-in or well-defined authentication.

- Controller and Fieldbus Pairing:
virtualized PLCs must support secure method of pairing, authenticating with their I/O devices. Virtualization allows multiple PLCs to control (or at least monitor) the same device. This can potentially lead to conflicts in device operation. Therefore, careful access control mechanisms are required to prioritize operation across the PLCs.

- Efficient Transport Protocol
Currently, factory-floor fieldbus devices do not directly use any transport protocols designed for the purpose, e.g., {{MQTT_SPEC}} and {{OPC_ARCH}}. The data collected from sensors is encapsulated in TCP. Alternate native transport based on principles of {{MQTT_SPEC}} could help to improve the traffic efficiency in industrial networks.

## Key Performance Indicator Requirements

- Process Control:
performance depends on the deterministic behavior of devices. A virtualized PLC must maintain all deterministic and low latency attributes of physical PLC.

- Safety mechanisms:
To keep a factory floor hazard and accident free environment, the virtualized PLC must implement mechanisms for proper operation of a devices which includes commands sent from vPLC must not exceed thresholds, are error-free and valid for the fieldbus operation.

- Security:
mechanisms should be implemented to protect man-in-the-middle attack. Encryption overheads must be budgeted from virtualized PLC to fieldbus to maintain process control latency. Due to low processing power, light-weight mechanisms should be devised.

## Network Related Requirements

The topologies in the manufacturing zones do not change frequently and devices are  designated in a zone or a cell for long-term use. Such observations can help simplify network designs. Industry networks could substantially benefit from a hybrid approach of software-defined networking and distributed routing. Former for initial provisioning (or controlled bootstrapping), latter for reachability and health of the fabric. Such hybrid approaches eliminate the need for implementing complex routing protocol features.

- Backward Compatibility:
seamless integration of virtualized PLCs must be supported. The network must supports legacy traffic and its performance should be no worse than before the inclusion of virtualized PLCs.

- Efficiency of connections:
industrial networks have different types of connection endpoints, such as PLC-PLC, PLC-SCADA, SCADA-IT-Systems, PLC-Firewalls, PLC-gateways, PLC-I/O modules. Without subscribing to a specific wire-format, a flexible packet format should be designed to address smooth connections between any of the above endpoints.  It implies a variety of endpoints interconnect in an identical fashion without requiring device specific translations. Efficient connections lead to less processing or states in the network with improved resiliency and performance.  There maybe opportunities to design packet formats with minimal overheads by using in-band programmability paradigms that carry embedded metadata and control information relating to reachability, latency, jitter, reliability, and exceptions characteristics. This type of approach is expected to reduce configurations and number of policies required for data steering through the network. Existing methods that maybe used, evaluated or extended include IP with TSN, DETNET{{DETNET}}, reachability headers SCHC, IPv6 compression schemes or may be evaluated against newer schemes.

- Traffic segmentation support:
As virtualized PLCs are spun off like VMs, connectivity with fieldbus devices will be affected. It should not have adverse effect on deterministic, low latency behavior on the other segmented traffic (i.e. connectivity between other set of endpoints). Each segmented traffic may be associated with a different protocol or traffic profile including legacy traffic format and profiles. The methods to support segmentation include virtual network technologies inside the fabric such as VxLAN, VPNs, etc.

- Resilient and Extensible Topologies:
The industry network protocols must not limit to a constrained physical topology. It must support  multi-path distributed connectivity framework to prevent bottlenecks, traffic concentration.
- Dynamic Bandwidth Management:
Even in the industrial networks high volume of data is being generated from the sensors. Managing bandwidth for different types of data (operational, control, statistics) should be supported through existing QoS or in-band monitoring technologies.

interfaces between enterprise and control systems.  In this widely deployed hierarchical model, five levels are defined and they follow a strict ordering of interfaces across the  levels. At the lowest level  0, are the physical devices while enterprise applications are at level 5. In between these two levels, there are several supervisory, management, and intermediate data collection applications that provide information to

## Separation between Manufacturing and Enterprise Networks
The ICA-95  architecture recommends hierarchy, thereby a separation between factory devices and applications through three different security zones called Manufacturing, DMZ and enterprise zones as shown in {{Automation}}  as below:

- Enterprise Security Zone:
: The IT applications reside in enterprise networks and perform tasks necessary for business operations such as inventory control, supply-chain logistics, schedule and capacity planning. They need to collect data from the OT systems in order to make those decisions.

- Industrial Demilitarized Zone:
: The OT and IT networks were designed to prevent direct communication between them. The IDMZ serves as an information sharing layer between the IT and OT (L4 and L3) systems. This indicates that additional security rules, inspection and protection of device identity and access is necessary when transiting from L3 to L4.

- Manufacturing Zone:
: Consists of Levels 0 through 3 site wide production system.  Operations at level 3 (L3) Support site-wide view of the production system. They also provide data to L4. Area supervisory control (L2) performs operation and control over a zone or smaller area in a production floor. Each area has specific set of tasks or operations to perform. Basic control  at level 1 (L1) is for the actual control of the equipment. The L1 components such include PLCs; they send commands to L0 equipments to perform tasks (e.g. start motor, alter pressure level, or reduce motor speed). Finally, actual process takes place at level 0 (L0). At this level for the process equipments performing actual operations are performed. This include equipment and devices such as motors, pressure valves, temperature, speed, etc sensors, etc.

The devices or controllers at level 1 are the ones of specific interest for virtualization and the corresponding challenges are covered in later section.

## Collaborating with SDOs with Industry Network Focus

The paradigms of networking in OT are quite different than IP based best-effort networking protocols. Yet, IETF protocols are extensively used in OT applications. Often, it is not possible to get contributors directly from the OT sectors, then it would make more sense to coordinate with well-established consortia where OT scenarios and requirements are is discussed may be utilized. Two well established foundations are IIC {{IIC}} and OPC-UA {{OPC}}.
For example, a {{IIC_TALK}} provided overview of IIC activities.

Industrial IoT Consortium (IIC) provides use cases, scenarios, and best-practice frameworks to solve specific problems and solution pain points. It is a rich resources of case studies and demonstrations of different test beds. The IIC itself is not involved in standards development, but may help in formalizing requirements, further insights into solutions developed in IETF, and potentially help adoption of those solutions.

Open Platform Communications-Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) provides interoperability across different hardware platforms using a standard data model. It standardizes various information models, corresponding client-server architecture and defines necessary access mechanisms to those information models.
The OPC-UA is an abstraction layer to provide common interface to different data look-up and event notifications. A number of information models are provided by OPC-UA can be found here {{OPC_INFO}}.
Foe example, OPC has a specification on PLCs. It abstracts PLC specific protocols (such as Modbus, Profibus, etc.) into a standardized interface allowing HMI/SCADA systems to interface with a middleware that converts generic-OPC read/write requests into device-specific requests and vice-versa.

> Note: OPC-UA information model similar to YANG?

IETF solutions will focus on leveraging or extending IETF technologies for IT and OT integration which is at the infrastructure or communication layer. Thus, providing protocols that could potentially benefit higher-level OPC-UA work.

Both IIC and OPC could provide guidance to the lower level work.

- For Discussion: assuming there is an IIN framework - how does it fit in the OPC-UA architecture and facilitate adoption of existing information models.
