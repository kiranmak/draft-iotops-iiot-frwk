## Motivation
To what extent, how and where IETF technologies can be leveraged for IIoT?
- **Better OT/IT integration**: all the way  from application to device
- **IIoT Cloudification**: Extension of OT networks to the edge or cloud

- **Virtualization**:  of software PLCs
    - a growing number of components (SCADA, MES, HMI, etc.) are becoming cloud based.
    - Device instances interact with different applications

### What's in the Framework

1. Integrated Industry Network (IIN)
    - design and technical requirements 
        - From device side as well as networks nodes


2. Infrastructure (limited-domains model)
    - Interconnection between public and special purpose networks using LDN nomenclature (RFC 8799).
    - Remain aligned with Industry control architures
3. Stakeholders
    - Identified 3 bodies of SDOs to approach to
